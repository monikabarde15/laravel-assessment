Laravel E-Commerce Assessment
Project Overview

This Laravel web application demonstrates:

Multi-authentication system (Admin & Customer)

Real-time updates using Websockets

Web push notifications

Efficient large-scale product import using Laravel queues and batch processing

This is a backend-focused project. The UI is minimal using Blade and TailwindCSS.

Separate login & registration for Admin and Customer.

Dashboards for each user type.

Route protection via middleware: auth:admin & auth:customer.

2. Product Management
